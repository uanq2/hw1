As a web developer I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that your own site is optimized for search engines

When I view the source code, I want to find semantic HTML elements
When I view the CSS file, I wan to see a more concise code
When I view the image elements, I want to find accessible alt attributes
When I click the Navigation bar buttons, I want to see they work
