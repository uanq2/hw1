A Marketing agency hired me to refactor their website. They want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that their own site is optimized for search engines

When I view the source code, I made sure it has semantic HTML elements
When I view the CSS file, I wan to see a more concise code
When I view the image elements, I want to find accessible alt attributes
When I click the Navigation bar buttons, I want to see they link to a part of the web site.
